**Summary:**
The talk explains “foundation models” (LLMs are one kind): models pre-trained on huge unlabeled corpora via next-token prediction that can be adapted to many downstream tasks by prompting or light fine-tuning. Benefits: strong performance and major productivity because little labeled data is needed. Costs: very high compute for training and inference. Risks: trust issues from web-scraped data (bias, toxicity, unknown sources). Beyond language, the same paradigm powers vision, code, chemistry (Moleformer), and climate models; IBM integrates these into products like Watson Assistant, Maximo Visual Inspection, and Red Hat Project Wisdom while researching efficiency and reliability.&#x20;

**Key points**

* Term “foundation model” comes from Stanford; single model → many applications.&#x20;
* Pretraining is generative; yet models can do non-generative tasks after tuning or prompting.&#x20;
* Advantages: performance from scale; faster task adaptation with little labeled data.&#x20;
* Disadvantages: expensive GPUs for train/infer; opaque and potentially biased training data.&#x20;
* Multimodal reach: text→image (e.g., DALL·E-like), code assistants, molecule and earth-science models; IBM is active across these.&#x20;
