Recession: output down, jobs weaken, credit tightens.

* Definition: a broad, significant decline in activity across the economy, lasting more than a few months. Think falling real GDP, sales, production, and rising unemployment.
* Why it happens: negative shocks (rates up fast, credit crunch, asset-price busts, external shocks, pandemics), or imbalances unwinding (over-leverage, bubbles).
* Fed control: the Fed cannot “prevent all recessions.” It can soften or amplify cycles via interest rates, guidance, and liquidity. Monetary policy works with lags.
* Link to unemployment: Okun’s law. When output is below potential, unemployment rises. Approx: Δu ≈ –½·(output gap growth). Hot economy ↓u; cold economy ↑u.

Money creation and QE, plain:

* “Print” = create bank reserves (central-bank liabilities) when buying assets. The Fed credits reserves to sellers’ banks and receives bonds. No presses; it’s balance-sheet entries.
* Why buy bonds: lower term premia and long rates, ease financial conditions, support credit markets when the policy rate is near zero.
* Transmission:

  1. Expectations: signals lower future short rates.
  2. Portfolio balance: remove duration from the market → long yields ↓.
  3. Mortgage/credit channels: MBS and corp purchases compress spreads.
  4. Wealth/cash-flow: higher asset prices, cheaper refinancing.
* Constraints/risks: inflation, financial-stability side effects, political/legal mandates, diminishing returns. QE is not helicopter money; it swaps assets (bonds ↔ reserves).

Phillips curve: inflation–slack mechanics.

* Modern form (expectations-augmented, New Keynesian):

  $$
  \pi_t=\mathbb E_t[\pi_{t+1}] + \kappa\,\tilde y_t + u_t
  $$

  where $\tilde y_t$ is the output gap (or, in unemployment space, $\pi_t=\mathbb E_t[\pi_{t+1}] -\alpha(u_t-u^*)+u_t^{\text{shock}}$).
* Intuition: when demand > capacity (positive gap), firms raise prices more easily; when slack is high, pricing power weakens.
* Expectations matter: anchored expectations flatten the curve; unanchored expectations steepen costs of disinflation.
* Short run vs long run: short run shows a trade-off; long run settles at $u=u^*$ (NAIRU) with inflation determined by expectations and policy credibility.
* Practical reads:

  * Tight labor market + anchored expectations → mild upward drift in inflation.
  * Same tightness + unanchored expectations → faster inflation.
  * Disinflation without a recession is easier if expectations are well anchored.

Taylor rule: a simple reaction function, not a handcuff.

* Baseline:

  $$
  i_t = r^* + \pi_t + \phi_\pi(\pi_t-\pi^*) + \phi_y(y_t-y^*)
  $$

  where $i_t$ is the policy rate, $r^*$ neutral real rate, $\pi^*$ target inflation, and $y_t-y^*$ the output gap.
* Interpretation:

  * If inflation > target, raise $i_t$ more than one-for-one ($\phi_\pi>1$) to lift real rates.
  * If output > potential, raise $i_t$ to cool demand.
  * If both below, cut.
* Common tweaks: use the unemployment gap, add interest-rate smoothing $i_t=\rho i_{t-1}+(1-\rho)\text{Taylor}$, or use core inflation.
* Why markets care: it’s a transparent yardstick. Large, persistent deviations need clear justification (financial stress, ZLB, supply shocks).

Micro examples:

1. Yield-curve read: 2y = 5.2%, 10y = 4.3% → inversion. Markets expect future cuts and slower growth. Recession odds up; unemployment likely to rise with a lag.
2. QE pulse: Fed buys \$50B/month in 10y Treasuries/MBS → duration removed → 10y yield falls \~10–30 bps (order-of-magnitude), mortgages cheaper, refi wave supports spending.
3. Taylor sketch: $\pi=3.5\%, \pi^*=2\%, r^*=0.5\%,\ \tilde y=0.5\%,\ \phi_\pi=1.5,\ \phi_y=0.5$.

   $$
   i \approx 0.5+3.5+1.5(1.5)+0.5(0.5)=6.5\%
   $$

   A much lower policy rate would require a rationale (e.g., financial stress).

One-liners to remember:

* Recession ≠ Fed switch. It’s macro gravity; policy changes the slope, not physics.
* QE swaps bonds for reserves. It lowers long rates; it does not directly “spend” into the real economy.
* Phillips curve is weak without expectations. Credibility is the hidden variable.
* Taylor rule = compass. Don’t sail blind, but don’t chain the rudder.
