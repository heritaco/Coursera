Repo = **repurchase agreement**. You sell a security today for cash and **promise to buy it back** soon at a slightly higher price. That higher price embeds the **interest**. Think “pawn shop for bonds.”

## One-day repo (overnight)

* You have \$10,000,000 in T-bills but need cash till tomorrow.
* Haircut 2% ⇒ lender gives you **\$9,800,000** today and holds your T-bills as collateral.
* Repo rate 5% per year, day count 360.
* Interest = $$9{,}800{,}000 \times 0.05 \times \tfrac{1}{360} \approx \$1{,}361.11$$.
* **Tomorrow you repurchase**: pay \$9,800,000 + \$1,361.11 = **\$9,801,361.11**, and get your T-bills back.

## 7-day repo

* Collateral: \$5,000,000 Treasuries. Haircut 4% ⇒ cash **\$4,800,000**.
* Repo rate 6%.
* Interest = $$4{,}800{,}000 \times 0.06 \times \tfrac{7}{360} = \$5{,}600$$.
* Repurchase price = **\$4,805,600**.

### Who is who

* **Repo borrower / seller**: needs cash now, **sells** the security today, **repurchases** later.
* **Repo lender / buyer**: provides cash now, **buys** the security today, **resells** later.
* **Reverse repo** = the same deal seen from the lender’s side.

Key ideas: collateralized, short-term, interest is baked into the **repurchase price**, haircut = safety buffer.
