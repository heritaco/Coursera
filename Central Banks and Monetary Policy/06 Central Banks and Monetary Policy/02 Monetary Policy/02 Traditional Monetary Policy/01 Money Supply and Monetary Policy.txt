# Abstract

Define money precisely. Map aggregates (monetary base, M1, M2, M3) to balance-sheet mechanics. Show how reserve policy and open-market operations shift deposits via the **money multiplier**, then connect money growth to inflation through the **quantity equation**. Note the empirical breakdown of stable money–inflation links since 2000, so most central banks target **interest rates** and treat aggregates as context, not levers. 

# Glossary

* **Monetary base (MB):** Currency in circulation + bank reserves at the Fed. Policy-controllable. 
* **Reserves:** Banks’ deposits at the Fed used to settle payments and meet requirements. 
* **M1:** MB + transactions deposits (checking). Captures cash and spendable deposits. 
* **M2:** M1 + savings deposits, small time deposits, retail MMF shares. Broader, still liquid. 
* **M3 (historical):** M2 + large time deposits, institutional MMFs, short-term repos, other large liquid assets. Discontinued by the Fed. 
* **Money multiplier (m):** Deposit expansion from reserves; stylized (m \approx 1/\text{rr}) under fixed reserve ratio rr. 
* **Open-market operations (OMO):** Fed buys/sells Treasuries to add/drain reserves and influence deposits. 
* **Quantity theory / equation:** (M V = P Y). With (V, Y) roughly stable, money growth ≈ inflation. Empirically unstable post-2000.

## Summary with enhancements

1. **Measurement.** Start from the **monetary base** (currency + reserves). Build up to **M1**, **M2**, and the historical **M3** by adding progressively less liquid instruments. 
2. **Bank balance-sheet logic.** A deposit creates reserves and fundable loans; under a simple 10% reserve policy, each $1 of reserves supports up to about $10 of deposits in the textbook model. 
3. **Policy levers.**

   * **Reserve requirement:** Higher rr lowers (m); lower rr raises it.
   * **OMO:** Fed **sales** drain reserves and shrink deposits; **purchases** add reserves and expand deposits. 
4. **Macro link.** Historically, broad money (e.g., M3) co-moved with CPI inflation and nominal GDP. Since 2000—especially post-2008 and during COVID—these links weakened as new payment tech, shadow intermediation, and changing velocity broke stability. The Fed ceased publishing M3 and relies mainly on **rate targeting**, not money-stock targets. 

**Enhancements (analytic clarity).**

* The textbook multiplier assumes fixed rr, stable currency–deposit ratios, and loan demand; modern frameworks also consider **endogenous money creation**, interest on reserves, and floor-system implementation, which decouple reserve quantities from deposit creation at the margin.
* Use ( \Delta M \approx m ,\Delta MB ) as a **first-pass** mapping, then test against data; do not assume velocity (V) is constant.

## Worked example: everything together

**Setup.** Bank A receives a new $1,000 deposit. Assume rr (=10%) and ignore currency drain. Stylized (m=1/0.10=10).

1. **Expansion path (multiplier).**

   * Required reserves = $100; excess = $900 → loans $900.
   * Those loans re-deposit system-wide and repeat.
   * **Upper-bound deposit creation** (\approx $1{,}000 \times m = $10{,}000). Reserves system-wide remain $1,000 by construction. 

2. **Fed drains reserves via OMO.**

   * The Desk **sells** $50 of Treasuries to dealers; payment reduces bank reserves by $50.
   * With rr (=10%), the **maximum** supported deposits fall by (\Delta M \approx m,\Delta MB = 10 \times (-$50) = -$500). Credit supply tightens at the margin. 

3. **Macro translation (quantity equation).**

   * Suppose (Y) fixed in the short run and (V) near 5. If (M) falls $500 from a $50,000 baseline (−1%), then (P) tends to adjust about −1% absent offsetting changes in (V) or (Y).
   * In practice, (V) moves, so realized inflation deviates; hence the modern **rate-targeting** focus with aggregates as diagnostics.

**Takeaway.** Use aggregates to **frame** balance-sheet channels, use OMO to move reserves, use rr to modulate the textbook multiplier, and use (MV=PY) as a conditional lens. Treat the money–inflation link as contingent, not mechanical, in contemporary data. 

Short answer: the multiplier maps the **monetary base (MB)** to a chosen money aggregate. For any aggregate (X\in{\text{M1},\text{M2},\text{M3}}),
[
m_X \equiv \frac{X}{MB},\qquad \Delta X \approx m_X,\Delta MB.
]
In the textbook deposit-creation model with only transactions deposits, no currency drain, and a fixed reserve ratio (rr), (m_{\text{M1}}\approx 1/rr). With (rr=10%\Rightarrow m_{\text{M1}}\approx 10). 

How this ties to each aggregate

* **M1** = MB + checkable (transactions) deposits. Deposit expansion via lending is the canonical channel, so the simple multiplier applies most cleanly to M1 under strong assumptions. 
* **M2** = M1 + savings, small time deposits, retail MMF shares. You can still define (m_{\text{M2}}= \text{M2}/MB), but there is no fixed formula from (rr) alone; portfolio shifts into savings/MMFs move M2 independently of reserves. 
* **M3** (historical) = M2 + large time deposits, institutional MMFs, short-term repos, other large liquid assets. Again (m_{\text{M3}}=\text{M3}/MB) is an empirical ratio; the Fed stopped publishing M3 and its relationship with inflation/GDP has been unstable since ~2000.  

Policy levers and limits

* Raising **reserve requirements** lowers the deposit multiplier; **open-market operations** that drain reserves also contract deposit creation. These channels link MB to deposits and thus to measured money. 
* In practice, broad-money multipliers ((m_{\text{M2}}, m_{\text{M3}})) vary with payment tech and balance-sheet behavior, so they are not stable policy knobs. 

Concrete example

* Fed **buys** $50 of Treasuries → bank reserves +$50. With (rr=10%) and no currency drain, new checkable deposits can expand up to (\approx $500) → **M1** up (\sim $500). 
* If households promptly shift 40% of those new checking balances into savings/MMF shares, **M1** ends +$300 while **M2** ends +$500 (since savings/MMFs are in M2). Definitions drive that accounting, not a fixed (rr) formula. 

Bottom line: use the simple (1/rr) logic only for M1 under strong assumptions. For M2/M3, treat (m_X=X/MB) as a **measured** ratio that drifts with behavior and regulation, not a stable constant you can set from reserves alone.
