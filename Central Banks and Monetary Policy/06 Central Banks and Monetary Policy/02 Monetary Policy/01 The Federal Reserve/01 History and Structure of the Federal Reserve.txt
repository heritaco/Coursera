Central banks exist to stabilize prices and prevent bank runs; the Fed, founded in 1913 after recurrent panics, executes these functions through the Board of Governors, 12 Reserve Banks, and the FOMC. 

# Abstract

The lecture traces why central banks arise, then details the Federal Reserve’s origin and governance. Paper-money overissue and bank runs motivate two core functions: price stability via control of money and **lender of last resort** via collateralized emergency lending. The Federal Reserve Act (1913) institutionalized these functions in a tripartite structure—**Board of Governors**, **12 Regional Reserve Banks**, and the **FOMC**—that sets policy targets and operates the payments and supervisory apparatus. 

# Glossary

* **Central bank:** Public authority that controls money and provides emergency liquidity to solvent banks. 
* **Price stability:** Constraint against over-issuance of money that would cause inflation. 
* **Bank run:** Coordinated withdrawals when depositors doubt convertibility; can fell solvent but illiquid banks. 
* **Lender of last resort (LOLR):** Short-term central-bank loans against collateral to bridge liquidity shocks. 
* **Board of Governors:** Seven-member Washington, D.C. agency guiding System policy. 
* **Federal Reserve Banks:** Twelve regional banks that implement policy, supervise banks, and provide payment services. 
* **FOMC:** Committee that sets interest-rate targets; members are the seven Governors, the New York Fed President, plus four rotating Reserve Bank presidents. 

## Summary with enhancements

* **Historical motivation.** The 1660s Swedish case shows paper notes work if credibly redeemable; over-issuance triggers runs. The remedy is public control of money and an LOLR backstop. 
* **U.S. path.** After early central-bank experiments, the U.S. lacked a central bank from 1837 to 1913, culminating in the 1907 panic. The Federal Reserve Act restored monetary control and created an LOLR. 
* **Operating logic.** Banks transform maturities and hold fewer cash reserves than demandable claims. Liquidity shocks are systemic, so a central bank must lend against sound collateral when markets seize. 
* **Institutional design.** Governance balances central guidance with regional execution: the Board sets System policy, Reserve Banks supervise and lend, and the FOMC sets rate targets that anchor monetary policy. 
* **Policy coherence (enhancement).** Think of the Fed as a **triad**:

  1. **Mandate layer:** price stability + financial stability.
  2. **Decision layer:** FOMC target setting.
  3. **Implementation layer:** discount lending, supervision, and payment services at Reserve Banks.
     This mapping aligns statutory goals to market operations that prevent runs and stabilize purchasing power. 

## Worked example: everything together

**Scenario.** A solvent regional bank faces sudden withdrawals after rumors about its loan book. Its securities are hard to sell quickly without a discount.

**Actions.**

1. The bank pledges eligible loans and securities to its District Reserve Bank. It receives an LOLR advance to meet withdrawals. Convertibility is restored; the run stalls. 
2. Supervisors at the Reserve Bank examine the institution and monitor collateral quality. 
3. The FOMC meets and maintains its policy target, signaling that system liquidity needs are met without altering the macro stance. The Board communicates the framework, preserving confidence. 

**Outcome.** No forced fire sales. Payments clear. Depositors are paid. The bank survives an illiquidity shock, and price stability goals remain intact—illustrating how the Fed’s history-shaped structure operationalizes monetary control and crisis backstops.
