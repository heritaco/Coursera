**Summary.**  
The module explains the *plumbing* of monetary policy: which overnight markets matter, which rates are targeted, and which instruments transmit policy to the real economy. It centers on the federal funds and repo markets (cash/“money” markets) where the Fed steers overnight rates; compares those to LIBOR-like benchmarks used in loans; then moves to the key assets the Fed trades (U.S. government securities) to implement policy and read expectations via the yield curve (term structure). It adds two balance-sheet channels: money market mutual funds (major repo lenders, now directly in scope post-2008) and securitization—especially MBS—which link policy to credit supply and mortgage costs. The take-home: each video is one piece of the implementation chain; the full policy logic clicks in the next module. fileciteturn0file0

**Implementation flow (cause → effect).**  
FFR/Repo targets ↑ or ↓ → money-market rates move → bank funding costs change → loan/mortgage rates change → credit growth and spending adjust → output, employment, and inflation respond → the yield curve embeds expectations about all of the above.

**Key markets and why they matter.**  
- **Federal funds market:** unsecured overnight bank-to-bank cash. Primary policy target.  
- **Repo market:** secured overnight cash vs. Treasuries; alternative funding anchor the Fed also stabilizes.  
- **LIBOR vs. repo:** loan benchmarks tied to wholesale funding; tracking them shows pass-through to firms.  
- **Money market mutual funds:** largest cash lenders in repo; now part of the operating framework.  
- **Government securities:** the Fed’s main tool; “risk-free” curve reveals inflation and policy-path expectations.  
- **Securitization/MBS:** converts loans to tradable bonds; Fed purchases here shift mortgage spreads and credit supply.

**What to read off the yield curve (term structure).**  
Level = average expected short rates + term premium.  
Slope ↑ = markets expect firmer growth/inflation; slope ↓ or inverted = markets expect future cuts/slowdown.

**Minimal exam checklist.**  
- Name the **targeted overnight rates** and how the Fed pins them (FFR corridor/floor; repo facilities).  
- Explain **why repo matters** even if FFR is the headline.  
- Decompose **yields** into expected short rates + term premium.  
- Describe **MMMFs’ role** in repo and post-crisis policy operations.  
- Trace **MBS purchases → mortgage rates → housing/credit**.

**Common pitfalls to avoid.**  
- “QE = printing for spending.” No. It swaps bonds for reserves and works via rates/spreads.  
- “Only the FFR matters.” Overnight secured rates and repo plumbing can dominate transmission in stress.  
- “Yield curve = only growth.” It’s growth *and* policy-path expectations *and* term premium.




**Targeted overnight rates + how the Fed pins them**

* **Target:** Effective federal funds rate (FFR) within a target range.
* **Floor system:**

  * **IORB** (interest on reserve balances) = floor for **banks**.
  * **ON RRP** = floor for **nonbanks** (MMMFs, GSEs).
  * **Primary credit rate** (discount window) + **Standing Repo Facility (SRF)** cap spikes and stabilize repo/SOFR.
* Net: administered rates + ample reserves keep FFR and repo rates inside the band.

**Why repo matters even if FFR is the headline**

* Modern funding is **secured**; most contracts float off **SOFR** (a repo rate), not FFR.
* Repo sets the **opportunity cost of cash** for banks and nonbanks, anchors bill yields, and transmits policy to money-market and credit spreads.
* When repo is unstable, transmission breaks even if FFR is on target.

**Yield decomposition**

$$
y_t(\tau)= \underbrace{\frac{1}{\tau}\sum_{k=1}^{\tau}\mathbb E_t[r_{t+k}]}_{\text{expected future short rates}} \;+\; \underbrace{\text{term premium}_t(\tau)}_{\text{compensation for duration/convexity/liquidity risk}}
$$

* Policy moves expectations; QE and balance-sheet tools move the **term premium**.

**MMMFs’ role in repo and post-crisis ops**

* MMMFs are **dominant cash lenders** in tri-party and ON RRP.
* Post-crisis: the Fed’s **ON RRP** gives MMMFs a safe floor investment, which:

  * Enforces the **lower bound** for overnight rates.
  * Absorbs/supplies liquidity during flows (“dash for cash” episodes).
* Shifts since 2014–2016 reforms: larger **government** MMMFs, tighter links to the policy floor.

**MBS purchases → mortgage rates → housing/credit**

**MBS** = mortgage-backed securities (pass-throughs, CMOs) issued by GSEs (Fannie/Freddie) and Ginnie Mae.
1. **Fed buys MBS/Treasuries** → removes duration/prepayment risk from the market.
2. **MBS yields fall** (portfolio-balance effect) and **mortgage-MBS spread** compresses.
3. **Primary mortgage rates drop** → refis rise, monthly payments fall, affordability improves.
4. **Housing demand/prices** lift → collateral values rise → easier credit via bank/balance-sheet and wealth channels.

Want me to add a one-page cheat sheet with mini equations and a tiny diagram of the floor system and the MBS channel?
