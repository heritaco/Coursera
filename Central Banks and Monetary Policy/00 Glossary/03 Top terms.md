Here are the **20 high-leverage concepts** you’ll see on every exam or policy brief. Plain words, tight math, concrete examples, meme energy kept efficient.

---

## 1) Inflation, CPI, PCE, and “real” vs “nominal”

* **Nominal** = sticker number. **Real** = adjusted for inflation.
* Core identities:

  * Real rate: $r \approx i - \pi$ (Fisher).
  * Real GDP: $ \text{real} = \frac{\text{nominal}}{\text{price index}}$.
* **CPI** tracks consumer basket; **PCE** is Fed’s fave (broader, updates weights).
* **Example:** Savings at $i=5\%$ while inflation $\pi=6\%$ ⇒ $r\approx -1\%$. Your cash is on a treadmill.

---

## 2) Output/GDP gap and “potential”

* **Output gap** $= y - y^*$. $y^*$ = sustainable, non-inflationary output.
* **Sign:**

  * $y>y^*$ = economy running hot ⇒ upward inflation pressure.
  * $y<y^*$ = slack ⇒ downward inflation pressure.
* **Use:** Phillips-style thinking and Taylor Rule both look at this.

---

## 3) Phillips Curve (modern, expectations-augmented)

* Short-run tradeoffs exist because inflation expectations move slow.
* Stylized form: $\pi_t = \mathbb{E}_t[\pi_{t+1}] + \kappa \tilde{y}_t + u_t$.
* **Reads:** If the gap $\tilde{y}_t$ > 0, inflation tends to drift up unless credibility anchors expectations.
* Meme: if expectations get “unanchored,” inflation speedruns.

---

## 4) Fisher equation and why it matters

* **Exact:** $(1+i)=(1+r)(1+\pi^e)$. For small rates: $i \approx r+\pi^e$.
* **Use:** To get real borrowing costs from nominal quotes.
* **Example:** If 10Y Treasury $i=4\%$ and breakeven inflation $=2.3\%$ ⇒ $r\approx1.7\%$.

---

## 5) Yield curve and inversion

* **Term structure:** $i(\tau)$ vs maturity $\tau$.
* **Normal:** Upward slope (term premium + growth/inflation risk).
* **Inverted:** Short rates > long rates ⇒ markets price cuts later ⇒ classic recession signal.
* **Decompose:** $ i_{t,t+\tau} \approx \frac{1}{\tau}\sum_{k=1}^{\tau} \mathbb{E}[i^{\text{short}}_{t+k}] + \text{term premium}$.

---

## 6) Policy rate, FFR, and the corridor/floor system

* **FFR** = overnight unsecured interbank rate.
* Today Fed uses **floor system**: set **IORB** and **ONRRP** to pin money-market rates.
* **Order of battle:**

  * Raise IORB/ONRRP ⇒ floor lifts ⇒ money-market rates follow ⇒ credit tightens.
  * Cut them ⇒ floor drops ⇒ easier credit.
* Meme: “Set the floor, watch the room obey.”

---

## 7) Open Market Operations (OMO) vs QE

* **OMO:** small, frequent T-bill trades to keep the policy rate on target.
* **QE/LSAPs:** large, persistent buys of longer-dated bonds/MBS to compress term and mortgage spreads when policy rate is at or near zero.
* **Mechanism:** duration extraction + portfolio balance.
* **Tell:** OMO = steering wheel; QE = turbo button.

---

## 8) Forward guidance

* Central bank saying “we’ll hold rates at X for Y” to shape expectations now.
* **Power:** Moves long rates through expectations channel even if today’s rate unchanged.
* **Risk:** Credibility hit if they don’t follow through.

---

## 9) Taylor Rule (why markets care)

* One common form:

  $$
  i_t = r^* + \pi_t + \phi_\pi(\pi_t-\pi^*) + \phi_y(y_t - y^*)
  $$
* **Reads:** If inflation > target or output > potential, rule says hike.
* **Use:** Compass, not a handcuff.

---

## 10) Money, reserves, and the “multiplier” myth

* **Monetary base:** currency + bank reserves.
* **Multiplier (old textbook):** $M = m \cdot B$.
* **Modern view:** With ample reserves and IORB, **credit demand and capital** bind more than reserve quantity. Banks aren’t reserve-constrained in the same way.

---

## 11) Discount window, stigma, and liquidity backstops

* **Discount window:** emergency borrowing for banks at the Fed’s rate.
* **Primary credit:** for sound banks; **secondary:** troubled banks.
* **Reality:** Stigma exists. Banks prefer market funding or the Standing Repo Facility when available.

---

## 12) Repo, collateral, haircuts, specials

* **Repo:** cash for collateral today, reverse it later at price = interest.
* **Haircut:** lender’s safety margin.
* **Specials:** on-the-run Treasuries with extra demand ⇒ cheaper to borrow cash against them.
* **Why policy cares:** Repo transmits rates to funding and credit quickly.

---

## 13) Securitization, MBS/ABS, and why mortgages got cheap

* **Securitization:** pool loans → slice cash flows by risk (**tranches**).
* **MBS:** mortgage pools; **ABS:** other loans (autos, cards).
* **QE in MBS:** compresses mortgage spreads ⇒ cheaper home loans.
* **Risk:** if underwriting is sus, tranches melt (2008 lore).

---

## 14) Leverage, liquidity, and why crises go nonlinear

* **Leverage:** assets/equity.
* **When prices fall:** leverage spikes, margin calls force sales, prices fall more ⇒ doom loop.
* **Policy lever:** lender of last resort + facilities to stop firesale dynamics.

---

## 15) Expectations and credibility

* **Sticky expectations** give policy traction; **unanchored** expectations make policy costly.
* **Credibility asset:** Hard-won, easy to lose.
* **Heuristic:** Consistent reaction function ⇒ anchored expectations ⇒ flatter Phillips tradeoffs.

---

## 16) Fiscal vs monetary

* **Monetary:** price stability + employment via interest rates, guidance, balance sheet.
* **Fiscal:** taxes/spending/transfers.
* **When zero lower bound hits:** fiscal multiplier tends to be larger; monetary leans on QE/FG.

---

## 17) Term premium

* Extra yield investors demand for holding duration risk.
* **Low term premium:** long rates mostly expectations of future short rates.
* **QE effect:** compresses term premium via duration removal.

---

## 18) Banking panics, deposit insurance, and “breaking the buck”

* **Bank run:** fear → withdrawals → liquidation at bad prices.
* **Deposit insurance** calms retail runs.
* **MMMF “break the buck”:** share < \$1 ⇒ run dynamics for funds. Policy stood up facilities to halt stampede.

---

## 19) Prime, SOFR, LIBOR and reference rates

* **LIBOR → SOFR migration:** from survey-based to market-based, secured, overnight.
* **Prime rate:** banks’ posted best customer rate; follows policy with a spread.
* **Why you care:** floating loans reset to these.

---

## 20) Unconventional policy playbook (when rates hit zero)

* **QE/LSAPs:** compress term/mortgage spreads.
* **Yield-curve control (rare):** cap selected maturities.
* **Funding facilities:** keep commercial paper, corporate credit, or repo plumbing from freezing.
* **Forward guidance:** lock expectations to pull long rates down.

---

# Ultra-compact “how to think” map

* **If $\pi$ high and unanchored:** hike $i$, signal resolve, shrink balance sheet.
* **If $\tilde{y}<0$ and ZLB binds:** QE + forward guidance; handoff to fiscal.
* **If curve inverts:** market prices future cuts; watch labor/credit.
* **If funding spreads blow out:** open collateralized facilities, lend against safe paper, cap panic.
* **Always:** protect credibility; communicate rule-like behavior.

---

# Micro examples you can reuse

1. **Loan decision in real terms**

* Offer: 8% nominal for 3y; expected inflation 5%.
* Real ≈ 3%. If your project returns 2% real, don’t borrow, bro.

2. **Yield curve read**

* 2Y = 5.0%, 10Y = 4.2% ⇒ inversion $= -80$ bps. Market thinks policy will be tighter now, looser later. Hedge duration.

3. **Taylor sketch**

* $\pi=3.5\%$, $\pi^*=2\%$, $y-y^*=+0.5\%$, $r^*=0.5\%$, $\phi_\pi=1.5$, $\phi_y=0.5$.
* $i \approx 0.5 + 3.5 + 1.5(1.5) + 0.5(0.5)= 0.5+3.5+2.25+0.25=6.5\%$.
* Markets will side-eye any stance far below that unless justified.

4. **Repo math**

* Post \$10M Treasuries, 2% haircut ⇒ borrow \$9.8M.
* If repo rate = 5% annual for 7 days ⇒ interest $$\approx 0.05 \times \frac{7}{360}\times 9.8\text{M} \approx \$9{,}528$$.

# Quick meme anchors

* **QE:** “Money printer go brrr,” but really “duration vacuum.”
* **Inversion:** “Curve doing a handstand = vibes are off.”
* **Discount window:** “Emergency Gatorade for dehydrated banks.”
* **Term premium:** “Payment for holding the hot potato longer.”
* **Anchored expectations:** “Everyone believes the teacher’s grading rubric.”
