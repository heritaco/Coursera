Question 1
For Questions 1-4, refer to the following table regarding passengers of the famous Titanic, which tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. The table organizes passenger/crew counts according to the class of their ticket and whether they survived.


If we randomly select a person's name from the complete list of passengers and crew, what is the probability that this person travelled in 1st class? Round your answer to two decimal places.

Question 5
For Questions 5-9, consider the following scenario:

You have three bags, labeled A, B, and C. Bag A contains two red marbles and three blue marbles. Bag B contains five red marbles and one blue marble. Bag C contains three red marbles only.

If you select from bag B, what is the probability that you will draw a red marble? Express the exact answer as a simplified fraction.

Question 7
Marbles:

Suppose a bag is randomly selected (again, with equal probability), but you do not know which it is. You randomly draw a marble and observe that it is blue. What is the probability that the bag you selected this marble from is A? That is, find 
P
(
A

blue
)
P(A∣blue)P, left parenthesis, A, \mid, start text, b, l, u, e, end text, right parenthesis. Round your answer to two decimal places.
